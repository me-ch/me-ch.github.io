      <h3 class="post-title">Regarding self gratification</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
       <p>
        This is a very important topic I would like to discuss. Self gratification 
        I feel is a very important problem for young people like me, we seek pleasure
        in everything we do, and if it is not instant we immediately stop whatever we are doing.
        My own hypothesis is that we were born in an age where enterntainment is like a
        drug. We consume entertainment that is purposefully engineered to make us addicted.
        The worst offenders are video games and social media due to how well companies that
        are based on these forms of media have mastered the art of attention engineering.
        However, no form of media is as addictive as porn. More on this topic 
        <a href="https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/">here</a>. I used to be addicted to all
        of these, except for porn. I always feared getting addicted to it, so I have purposefully
        avoided it. The healthiest thing to do is to reduce consumption of contemporary enternatinement such as
        the ones previously mentioned, tv shows, youtube, etc.

       <p>
        A strange journey is the one i am finding myself in. I never thought I<br>
        would make a website but every developer needs a blog. After learning<br>
        <em>C</em>,<em>C++</em>, <em>Java</em>, <em>Python</em> and <em>Assembly</em> it feels very different to use web dev<br>
         tools. On a completely unrelated note, check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl0wIdGxfbQ">this</a> out.
